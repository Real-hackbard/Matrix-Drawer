In mathematics, a matrix (pl.: matrices) is a [rectangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle) array of numbers or other [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object) with elements or entries arranged in rows and columns, usually satisfying certain properties of addition and multiplication.

In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), matrices are used as [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map). In geometry, matrices are used for [geometric transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation) (for example rotations) and coordinate changes. In [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis), many computational problems are solved by reducing them to a matrix computation, and this often involves computing with matrices of huge dimensions. Matrices are used in most areas of mathematics and scientific fields, either directly, or through their use in geometry and numerical analysis.

An m × n matrix: the m rows are horizontal and the n columns are vertical. Each element of a matrix is often denoted by a variable with two subscripts. For example, a2,1 represents the element at the second row and first column of the matrix.

Square matrices, matrices with the same number of rows and columns, play a major role in matrix theory. The [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of a square matrix is a number associated with the matrix, which is fundamental for the study of a square matrix; for example, a square matrix is [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix) if and only if it has a nonzero determinant and the eigenvalues of a square matrix are the roots of its [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial), det (AI-A).

Matrix theory is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of matrices. It was initially a sub-branch of linear algebra, but soon grew to include subjects related to [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), algebra, [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) and statistics.

# Size:
The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns it contains. There is no limit to the number of rows and columns that a matrix (in the usual sense) can have as long as they are positive integers. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m × n matrix, or m-by-n matrix, where m and n are called its dimensions. For example, the matrix (A) above is a 3 × 2 matrix.
